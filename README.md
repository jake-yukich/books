_Tracking books read in 2025. Planning to make a dataset and run some cool visualizations and such._

## Reading List
1. `The Amulet of Samarkand` | `Jonathan Stroud` | `✅ 20250103` | `462 pages`

> I decided to start the year off by rereading one of my childhood favorites and, in doing so, rekindled my passion not only for reading but also for one day becoming a magician capable of summoning formiddable djinn.

2. `Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?` | `Philip K. Dick` | `✅ 20250111` | `224 pages`

3. `CLOG x Artificial Intelligence` | `multiple` | `✅ 20250119` | `180 pages`

4. `The Death of Ivan Ilyich` | `Leo Tolstoy` | `✅ 20250201` | `53 pages`

> Tolstoy's novella is dark and dense. I found that while the prose certainly had its moments, overall it was a bit too thick and redundant for my liking. The message is, however, as salient today as it ever was.
